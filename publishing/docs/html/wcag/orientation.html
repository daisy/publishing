				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can read the content regardless of the
					orientation of their device. If the user cannot hold the device but requires it to be mounted, for
					example, changing the orientation is not always possible.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>To meet this success criterion, ensure that the content remains readable regardless of whether the
					device is in portrait or landscape orientation.</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion typically is not an issue for reflowable content as, by nature, this type of
					content adapts to orientation changes.</p>
				
				<p>Fixed layouts, on the other hand, are generally difficult to impossible to make conformant with this
					requirement because their layouts depend on a specific orientation.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on creating fixed layouts that can adapt
					to orientation changes due to a lack of viable techniques at this time.</p>
